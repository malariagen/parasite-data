# **Pf7 Analysis Guides*:** Population Structure and Selection 

The notebooks below cover the population genetic analysis of Pf7 samples. You can run analyses of population structure (PCoA, NJT) or look at selection in the gene *eba175*, for example.  

All of these notebooks are executable with Google Colaboratory, a free interactive computing service. To run a notebook for yourself, simply click the launch icon (shaped like a rocket) at the top of the notebook and select **"Colab"**.
