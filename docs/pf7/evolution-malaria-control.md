# **Pf7 Analysis Guides*:**Study Evolution Against Malaria Control Measures

The notebooks below walk through the analysis of evolution against malaria control measures in Pf7 samples.  Current topics include resistance to antimalarial drugs and genetic variation in genes linked to rapid diagnostic test failure (*hrp2* and *hrp3*) and vaccine escape (*csp*). 

All of these notebooks are executable with Google Colaboratory, a free interactive computing service. To run a notebook for yourself, simply click the launch icon (shaped like a rocket) at the top of the notebook and select **"Colab"**.
