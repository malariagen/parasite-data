# **Pf7 Analysis Guides:** Useful Genomics How-Tos

These notebooks cover different techniques for the genomic analysis of Pf7 data, which are not explicitly linked to a display item from the [Pf7 paper.](https://wellcomeopenresearch.org/articles/8-22/v1)

All of these notebooks are executable with Google Colaboratory, a free interactive computing service. To run a notebook for yourself, simply click the launch icon (shaped like a rocket) at the top of the notebook and select **"Colab"**.
