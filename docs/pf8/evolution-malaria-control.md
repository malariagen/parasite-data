# **Pf8 Analysis Guides:** Study Evolution Against Malaria Control Measures

The notebooks below walk through the creation of display items from the Pf8 manuscript that track the evolution of *P.falciparum* against malaria control measures.  Current topics include geographical patterns of inferred resistance to antimalarial drugs and genetic variation in genes linked to rapid diagnostic test failure (*hrp2* and *hrp3*). 

All of these notebooks are executable with Google Colaboratory, a free interactive computing service. To run a notebook for yourself, simply click the launch icon (shaped like a rocket) at the top of the notebook and select **"Colab"**.
