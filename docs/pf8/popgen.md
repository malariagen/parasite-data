# **Pf8 Analysis Guides:** Population Structure and Selection 

The notebooks below cover the population genetic analysis of Pf8 samples. You can run analyses of population structure (PCoA, NJT) or look at population-level patterns of sample clonality. 

All of these notebooks are executable with Google Colaboratory, a free interactive computing service. To run a notebook for yourself, simply click the launch icon (shaped like a rocket) at the top of the notebook and select **"Colab"**.
